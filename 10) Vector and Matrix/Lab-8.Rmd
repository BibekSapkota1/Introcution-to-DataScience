# vector and Matrices

## Vectors

task 1:Sequence of number from 8.5 to down 4.5
```{r}
8.5:4.5 
```

task-2: Value concatenated into single vector
```{r}
c(1, 1:3, c(5,8), 13)
```

task-3:Printing the vector function.
```{r}
vector("numeric",5)
vector("complex",5)
vector("logical",5)
vector("character",5)
vector("list",5)
```

## Indexing Vector

```{r}
x <- (1:5) ^ 2
x
```

```{r}
x[c(1,3,5)]
```

```{r}
x[c(-2,-4)]
```

```{r}
(three_d_array <- array
 (1:24,
   dim=c(4,3,2),
   dimnames=list(
     c("one","two","three","four"),
     c("first","second","third"),
     c("un","deux")
   )))
```

```{r}
class(three_d_array)
```
